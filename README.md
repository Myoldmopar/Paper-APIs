# Hello

This repo holds the source, build rules, and resources, for a ground heat transfer paper.

# Build Status [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Myoldmopar/GroundHeatFlowsPaper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Myoldmopar/GroundHeatFlowsPaper)

All commits are built by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org).  The current status of the master branch is shown by the badge above.  To generate a pdf, just create a tag on the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Myoldmopar/GroundHeatFlowsPaper/releases).  A build is currently taking on the order of 80 seconds since the build system must download and install TeX.  Once complete, a pdf will be posted to the release...if it is successful.
