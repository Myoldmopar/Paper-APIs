Data
----

This is where we will store the data files, worksheets, csv, etc., used to generate plots and tables in the document.  And this is also where we will store the scripts (gnuplot, e.g.) that take the data and convert it into plot images to be placed in ../tex/images-generated.

This way the build system can generate the figures from raw data and we'll never have outdated figures with unknown data sources.
